## Objective
* To create a 2D space shooter game where the goal is to achieve a high score

## Key Features
* All-direction movement for the player using arrow keys
* Ability to shoot lasers after regular time intervals
* Enemy spaceships spawning after regular time intervals
* Moving space background
* Random obstacles like asteroids that take player's lives if touched
* Bonus stars that appear after regular intervals and give the player extra lives if touched
* Score and life trackers on screen

## Additional Goals
* Enemy AI that also has three lives and can get bonus lives
* Player ship rotation for firing in all directions
* Two player version using wasde for the second player
* Sounds and background music
* Sprite effects when collisions occur (ex: a blinking red glow from player after just losing a life)
* Power ups (invincibility, super speed, rapid fire lasers, etc)

## Possible Libraries
* ofxSoundStream for handling music and sound effects
* ofxGUI for displaying text and game screen attributes
* openGL for more realistic gameplay (but most likely not)
* ofxExplosion for animating collisions with lasers
